# Chapter 1: What is UX Strategy ?

---

### 1.1 What is a Strategy ?
>` The purpose of any strategy is to create a game plan that looks at your current position and then helps you get to where you actually want to be. `

>>_Your strategy should play to your strengths and be mindful of your weaknesses._

---

### 1.2 What is a UX Strategy ?

>
- UX strategy is the process that should be started first, before the design or development of a digital product begins. 
- It’s the vision of a solution that needs to be validated with real potential customers to prove that it’s desired in the marketplace. 
- It is the high-level plan to achieve one or more business goals under conditions of uncertainty.

### 1.3 UX Design v/s UX Strategy ?

>Although UX design encompasses numerous details such as visual design, content messaging, and how easy it is for a user to accomplish a task, UX strategy is the “Big Picture.” 

---
# Chapter 2: Four tenets of UX strategy ?

---
### 2.1 UX strategy framework
> `UX Strategy = Business Strategy + Value Innovation + Validated User Research + Killer UX Design`

---
### 2.2 UX strategy framework: Business Strategy
##### `Business Strategy` + Value Innovation + Validated User Research + Killer UX Design
>>
- The business strategy identifies the company’s guiding principles for how it will position itself and still achieve its objectives.
- For this to happen, the business must continually identify and utilize a competitive advantage.

---
### 2.2.1 Business Strategy: competitive advantage
>> two most common ways to achieve a competitive advantage: `cost leadership` and `differentiation`

---
### 2.2.2 Business Strategy: conclusion
> 
- building a business strategy `isn’t about formulating and executing a perfect plan`
- it’s about being able to research what’s out there, analyze the opportunities, run structured experiments, fail, learn, and iterate until we devise something of value that people truly want
- as the product scales and the market evolves, the business strategy must be nimble

---
### 2.2 UX strategy framework: Value Innovation
##### Business Strategy + `Value Innovation` + Validated User Research + Killer UX Design
>> “Value Innovation = The simultaneous pursuit of `differentiation` and `low cost`” - Inspired by Blue Ocean Strategy

>>>> `Blue ocean v/s Red ocean`

---
### 2.2.1 UX strategy framework: Value Innovation
> What is Innovation?
>> `Innovative means doing something that is new, original, and important enough to shake up a market`

---
### 2.2.2 UX strategy framework: Value Innovation
> Sustainable Innovation v/s Disruptive Innovation
- `Sustainable Innovation` any innovation that enables industry leaders to do something better for their existing customers
- A `disruptive innovation` is a product that a company’s best customer potentially can’t use and therefore has substantially lower profit margins than the business might be willing to support

---
### 2.3 UX strategy framework: Validated User Research
##### Business Strategy + Value Innovation + `Validated User Research` + Killer UX Design
>
- Stakeholders are dreamers in that they assume what is valuable to their customers instead of verifying it.
- Validation is the process of confirming that a specific customer segment finds value in your product.

---
### 2.3.1 UX strategy framework: Validated User Research
> `The bottom line is that confronting your target customers is nonnegotiable. We must learn as quickly as possible if the idea we are working on is stupid and worthless.`

---
### 2.4 UX strategy framework: Killer UX Design
##### Business Strategy + Value Innovation + Validated User Research + `Killer UX Design`
> UX: User Experience, how users are feeling while interacting with your product/service
> It encompasses all touch-points, physical and digital
> It’s only when the UX is informed by and affects the other three tenets that mental models are broken. Disruption erupts!
